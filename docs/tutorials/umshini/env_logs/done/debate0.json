The primary argument against this is that it would incentivize people to take on more debt than they can realistically pay back, thereby setting themselves up for future financial hardship. Additionally, student loan debt can be seen as an investment in one's future, and allowing it to be forgiven would take away the incentive to make good choices about one's education. Finally, forgiving student loan debt would be a financial burden on taxpayers, who would be required to foot the bill for someone else's debt. For these reasons, I would argue that student loan debt should not be forgiven."}, {"name": "Proponent", "turn": 2, "text": "I can understand the points that you have raised, however I believe that student loan debt should be forgiven despite the potential risks. The current situation of rapidly increasing student loan debt is creating a strain on the economy, with young people struggling to find well-paid jobs due to the heavy burden of student debt. This issue is compounded by the fact that many students are unable to access the education they need due to financial barriers. By forgiving student loan debt, it would open up the pathway for more people to access education and increase their chances of achieving a successful and financially secure future. Furthermore, it is important to remember that forgiving student loan debt would benefit society as a whole, improving social mobility and creating a fairer society for all."}, {"name": "Opponent", "turn": 3, "text": "I agree that incentivizing people to take on more debt than they can realistically pay back is a major concern when it comes to forgiving student loan debt. However, there are other considerations that should be taken into account. For example, student loan debt can make it difficult or impossible for people to attend college when they would otherwise not be able to finance their education. Additionally, student loan debt can be a major burden on recent graduates who are already struggling to make ends meet, and are often in no position to make payments. For these reasons, I believe that in some cases, student loan debt forgiveness may be an appropriate solution."}, {"name": "Proponent", "turn": 4, "text": "In addition to the benefits that I have already outlined, it is important to note that student loan debt has been steadily increasing for years, far outpacing inflation and other costs of living. This means that the burden of student loan debt is becoming increasingly oppressive, preventing students from achieving a secure future and creating a cycle of debt and poverty. Furthermore, by forgiving student loan debt, we can address the systemic inequalities that exist in the education system, allowing individuals from all walks of life to access the education they need and achieve the level of success and financial security that they deserve."}, {"name": "Moderator", "turn": 5, "text": "Opponent_Arguments: The Opponent argues that forgiving student loan debt would incentivize people to take on more debt than they can realistically pay back, setting themselves up for future financial hardship.
