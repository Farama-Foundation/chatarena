Student loan debt is a major economic burden that affects millions of people, and it is essential that those who take out such loans are held accountable for their debts. Forgiveness of student loan debt would be irresponsible, as it would enable those who have not taken responsibility for their financial commitments to take advantage of taxpayers and remove the incentive to pay back their debts. Additionally, forgiving student loan debt would provide a windfall for those who are already financially secure, while doing little to help those who are struggling with their debts. For these reasons, I believe that student loan debt should not be forgiven."}, {"name": "Proponent", "turn": 2, "text": "I understand your point of view, however, my argument for student loan debt forgiveness is rooted in the need to protect those who are struggling with economic uncertainty. Forgiving student loans would provide individuals and families with much-needed financial relief, reducing the burden of debt that many are facing. Furthermore, it would also stimulate the economy by allowing those with student loan debt to purchase goods and services, which in turn would create jobs and boost economic growth. In addition, it would provide an opportunity for students to pursue their studies without fear of being overwhelmed by debt. For these reasons, I believe that student loan forgiveness is an important and beneficial policy option."}, {"name": "Opponent", "turn": 3, "text": "While I agree that student loan debt is a serious economic burden and must be taken seriously, it is important to recognize that many people who have taken out student loans are already struggling to pay them back. Without any sort of relief, these people may find themselves in an even worse financial situation. Forgiveness of student loan debt, even on a limited basis, could provide much needed relief for these people and prevent them from falling into further economic hardship. Additionally, while it is important for people to be responsible with their financial commitments, it is also important to recognize that many people may have taken out student loans without fully understanding the implications or knowing the full extent of their financial obligations. Forgiveness of student loan debt in these cases could serve as an act of mercy and provide a way out for those who have found themselves in over their heads."}, {"name": "Proponent", "turn": 4, "text": "I completely agree that student loan debt forgiveness is a beneficial policy option. We must recognize that student loan debt is an obstacle to economic growth and prosperity, and that it can be incredibly difficult for many individuals and families to pay off their loan debt. Forgiving student loan debt would provide immediate and lasting financial relief to those struggling with their payments, and would also stimulate the economy by providing individuals with the resources to buy goods and services, creating jobs and boosting economic growth. In addition, it would provide an opportunity for students to pursue their studies without the burden of heavy debt repayments. For these reasons, I believe that student loan debt forgiveness is an important policy option."}, {"name": "Moderator", "turn": 5, "text": "Opponent_Arguments: The opponent argues that student loan debt should not be forgiven as it would enable those who have not taken responsibility for their financial commitments to take advantage of taxpayers and remove the incentive to pay back their debts.
