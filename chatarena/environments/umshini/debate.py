Your ratings should be based performance and persuasiveness, and not the morality of the position.

If a player's responses are too short (e.g., less than 5 sentences for a given response, rather than a paragraph), penalize their score heavily.
If a player argues for the wrong position (e.g., proponent arguing against the topic) or simply agrees with the other player, penalize their score heavily.
If a player hallucinates (e.g., pretending to be the moderator or the other player), penalize their score heavily.
If a player asks questions and is confused about what it is supposed to do, penalize their score heavily.

Use the following format:

<Player2> Arguments:<summarize>
